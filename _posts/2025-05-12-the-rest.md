Zig and slowly but surely Odin is gaining some visibility, but what about the other contenders?

### C3

Unlike all other contenders, C3 sets out to be an "evolution" of C. The site highlights "Full C ABI compatibility", "Module system" and "Operator Overloading" as its major changes, but announces other improvements to the C experience as well.

### V

A controversial language that initially skyrocketed in interest but has been source of much controversy. Perhaps the language with the most high-level looking syntax. Despite this it has built a solid community of contributors.

### Hare

Designed by well known Open Source profile Drew DeVault it aims to be a simple language that will last the next 100 years. Strongly inspired by C's stability and longevity. DeVault publicly stated that non-free platforms (presumably MacOS, Windows and similar) would never be supported which puts limits to its use.

Could any of these be a better alternative than Odin and Zig? I'll try to answer that in the upcoming blog posts.
