Since the 1980s, there have been innumerable attempts to supplant or augment C.

The greatest success, of course, has been C++ (originally “C with Classes”).

Did you know that there was a fair bit of research to improve or replace the [C preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor)? Even [James Gosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling), the designer of Java, wrote [one](https://swtch.com/gosling89ace.pdf).

[Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) was less successful than C++, but it nonetheless powered MacOS X and later iOS. Now largely supplanted by Swift, it still enjoyed its fair share of glory days.

As C++ grew, so did the discontent. Alternatives with garbage collection 
replaced the less low-level uses of C++, but in domains where C once 
held sway – such as game development — C++ had few rivals.

However, as the need for low-level safety mounted, Rust emerged to answer the call. Yet such safety is often overkill in non-critical areas like gaming, 
and in 2014 Jonathan Blow made quite the splash with his announcement of an [untitled programming language for game development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ) – later known as Jai.

This stirred up renewed interest in low-level languages, which led to the rise of indie languages like Zig and Odin.

So we end up with a timeline so far looking like C -> C++ -> Rust.

But what will happen now? Rust is ascendant, being fairly well known
– but what of the later alternatives such as Jai? Do they really
offer anything beyond what C/C++/Rust offers?

This is what I want to explore in later blog posts.
