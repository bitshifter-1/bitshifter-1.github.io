Alrighty.

Welcome to my dumping ground of thoughts, where I’ll be sharing my musings on programming, software design, and all things tech.

Privacy matters, and my opinions may occasionally tick off a prospective (or current) client. I’d rather not give my bosses any headaches over something I wrote here. 
Especially since I work in a business related to programming language tooling. Trust me, people can get real sensitive when you start criticizing their "darlings."

Feel free to browse, and I hope you find something useful here!
